# learn-java-swing

This repository is to help me learn more about Java, GUI's and Git.
I will be coding along with Bro Code's Swing tutorial on Youtube (https://youtu.be/Kmgo00avvEw?si=gRlBcvfXTvbBGBr8).
As I code along with the tutorial, I will use git to track changes to the project and push them here.
